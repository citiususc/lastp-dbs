# LA-SPTminer datasets

This project allows you to explore the datasets used in the validation of LA-STPminer algorithm. A Java implementation of the algorithm is available in https://github.com/citiususc/lastpminer. Using both projects the experiments shown in LA-STPminer paper can be replicated (please mind that different machines will have different performances).
